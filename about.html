            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>A small patriotic dream and unbounded love for our City of Joy – Kolkata helped create the concept of
                Kollolini Kolkata - not a Hotel but a cosy budget friendly home away from home which suits the needs of
                every traveller.

                Our ideology is “ ATITHI DEVO BHAVO” – Guest is God. So we believe in treating them with the best of
                what we have in terms of hospitality, amenities, standard and quality.

                We house 7 spacious rooms which includes double bedded super deluxe rooms, super deluxe single rooms,
                economy deluxe twin bedded rooms as well as economy deluxe double rooms. Rooms are beautifully furnished
                with wardrobes, sofas, tables, TV, AC, tea maker, bed side table, dressing unit and each room has a
                touch of love, affection and care.

                Amidst the hustle bustle of the city life Kollolini Kolkata proudly boasts about its surrounding peace
                and serenity in spite of its close proximity to the Passport Office, Acropolis Mall, Kasba Industrial
                Estate, Science City, Hospitals ( Ruby, Desun, Fortis, Medica, RTIICS- Devi Shetty, Peerless, AMRI,
                etc).

                Other than being surrounded by famous regular restaurant chains, Kollolini Kolkata tingles the tummy of
                her guests with the best of home cooked delicious authentic Bengali Cuisine which if not tried would
                mean missing the most heavenly experience.</p>
